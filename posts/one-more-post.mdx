title: Mental models for designers
description: Mental models are important in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and interaction design because they provide information about how users perceive the world and interact with products or services. Letâ€™s explore this concept more closely.

A mental model refers to an individual's internal representation of how something works in the real world. In the context of design, a mental model can refer to how users perceive and understand a product or service. This understanding is crucial for designers because they aim to align the design of a product or service with the users' mental models to ensure usability and a positive user experience.

For designers, there are several key mental models and related concepts:

1. **User's Mental Model vs. Designer's Model**: Users come with their pre-existing understanding of how a product or system should work based on their past experiences. Designers, on the other  hand, have an internal representation of how they believe the system works or should work. The closer the designer's model is to the user's mental model, the more intuitive and user-friendly     the product will be.

2. **Affordances**: These are the perceived and actual properties of an object that indicate how it should be used. For example, a flat plate on a door suggests pushing, while a handle suggests pulling.

3. **Signifiers**: These are signals or indicators that communicate where the action should take place. In digital design, a button that looks clickable (e.g., with a gradient or shadow) is a signifier.

4. **Feedback**: Once a user takes action, they expect feedback. This can be in the form of animations, sounds, haptic feedback, or other indications that their action was successful or unsuccessful.

5. **Constraints**: These are limitations on what can be done, often used to guide users toward the correct action. Constraints can be physical, logical, semantic, or cultural.

6. **Mapping**: The relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Good mapping ensures that users can predict the outcomes of their actions. For instance, the volume up button on a remote should increase the sound volume.

7. **Conceptual Models**: These provide users with a simplified understanding of how something works. For example, the desktop metaphor on computer operating systems gives users a conceptual model of files and folders as if they were tangible objects.

To create effective designs, it's crucial for designers to:

- **Research and Understand the Users**: By employing techniques like user interviews, surveys, and usability testing, designers can get a better grasp of users' mental models.

- **Iterate and Test**: Design isn't a one-shot process. It requires creating, testing, getting feedback, and iterating to ensure the design aligns well with the user's mental model.

- **Stay Updated**: As technology and societal norms change, so do users' mental models. Designers need to stay updated with these shifts to ensure their designs remain intuitive.

- **Educate When Necessary**: Sometimes, introducing a new concept or a paradigm shift is necessary. In these cases, designers might need to educate users through onboarding tutorials or tooltips.

In summary, a mental model in design refers to the internal representations and expectations users have regarding a product or system. Designers should aim to align their designs with these models to create user-friendly and effective products.
