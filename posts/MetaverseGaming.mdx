The term "metaverse" refers to a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality. In simpler terms, it's a space where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users. This concept is created by the convergence of physical virtual reality and augmented virtuality, often facilitated by the internet.

In the context of "metaverse gaming", here's what you might expect:

1. **Persistent Virtual Worlds**: Games in the metaverse often feature large, persistent worlds that continue to exist and evolve even when individual players log off. Think of games like "Second Life" or "EVE Online", but on a much grander and interconnected scale.

2. **Interconnected Experiences**: Rather than individual, isolated games, the metaverse suggests a connected ecosystem of experiences. A character or avatar you develop in one game or platform might be usable in another.

3. **Social Interactions**: A significant feature of the metaverse is social interaction. Players can meet, communicate, collaborate, compete, and even hold events in these virtual spaces.

4. **Economy and Ownership**: In many envisioned metaverses, players can buy, sell, and trade virtual goods. With the advent of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the idea of true digital ownership has become a significant talking point. Players might be able to buy virtual land, objects, or even unique digital fashion items for their avatars.

5. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: The metaverse is often imagined as being accessible from a variety of devices, including VR headsets, AR glasses, computers, smartphones, and more.

6. **User-Created Content**: Many envision the metaverse as a platform where users can not only interact but also create. This might range from designing buildings and landscapes to crafting games and experiences for other users.

7. **Blurring of Digital and Physical**: As AR technology advances, elements of the metaverse might start to blend into the real world, providing a seamless blend of digital and physical interactions.

Companies like Facebook (which rebranded to "Meta" in 2021), Epic Games, and many others have shown interest in developing or contributing to this idea of a metaverse. For example, platforms like "Fortnite" have already begun blurring the lines between traditional gaming and a broader metaversal experience by hosting concerts, movie trailers, and other events within the game.

The concept of the metaverse is still in development, and while many ideas and themes have been proposed, the eventual shape it will take remains to be seen. However, its potential to revolutionize gaming, social interaction, and even the nature of the internet is immense.
